\section*{Conclusions}

%reframethis based on our results
The results of our models may not be too surprising. Writing in 2006, \citeasnoun{Gillem2007} points out that the media focus on crime and other negative externalities seems to have less long term effect on people's attitudes than the physical presence of the base itself. The presence and massive land use of the base are more fundamental factors of opposition for people in Okinawa than the litany of social harms caused by the base.
